Machine Learning Models
Baseline Model: Random Forest
RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
Accuracy: 57.1%
Optimized Model: Random Forest (Tuned)
n_estimators=500, max_depth=10, max_features='log2'
Accuracy: 64.3%
Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearchCV
Tested multiple values for max_depth, n_estimators, min_samples_split, etc.
Best model accuracy: 58.9%
Gradient Boosting Model
GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=300, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1)
Accuracy: 50%
Deep Learning Model
Neural Network (Keras & TensorFlow)
Architecture:
4 Hidden Layers with ReLU activation
Output layer with Softmax activation for multi-class classification
Training Details:
loss='categorical_crossentropy'
optimizer='sgd' (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
Trained for 300 epochs
Key Insights & Learnings
🔹 Feature Engineering significantly impacts model performance
🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning improved accuracy from 57.1% → 64.3%
🔹 Deep Learning overfitting – model achieved 100% accuracy in training but performed poorly in validation
🔹 Using Adam Optimizer instead of SGD could improve deep learning training efficiency
